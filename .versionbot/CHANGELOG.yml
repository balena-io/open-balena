                We already enforce this in the hook itself, and this rule
                prevents

                devices that have provisioned with an invalidated hostapp release from

                ever PATCHing/updating after the fact. we ideally only want to enforce

                this rule at upgrade time, rather than always

                This reverts commit db990479be2611f24b6262e12e1dfa092473cea0.


                OpenBalena is not the place to do the config vars change for the private

                device types such as the UniPi Neuron so we revert this commit here.

                This causes problems with the redis level of the cache because
                clearing

                the cache requires clearing the entire redis database which is far more

                aggressive than we want to support

                This will reduce the load for the common case where active
                devices are

                not regularly deleted with the potential to briefly respond with a 401

                when a device is first deleted. There may also be a slight delay for

                restored devices to be able to communicate again however again that is

                a very rare case.

                This avoids issues where you pin an application to a release for
                which

                some devices are missing service installs. It also allows simplifying

                the "should track latest release" implementation as it no longer needs

                to care about creating service installs itself

                This now requires boolean config vars must be `true` or `false`,
                or

                not set if they're optional, previously we compared against just `true`

                so any other values would be treated as `false` which could be

                confusing in the case of eg `1`/`on`

                        Instantiating an `OData2AbstractSQL` instance can be

                        and as such reusing a memoized instance can provide a reasonable

                        We now support support passing an SBVR file or a model
                        specification

                        as well as an abstract sql model, and we also accept any file type that

                        is acceptable to nodejs `require` rather than just a JSON file

                                rather than relying on the fact the currently all type functions happen

                                to be integers

        Port 3128, which was used for tunneling into devices, was plain TCP and

        (see #101). balena-cli versions before v12.38.5 are now incompatible and
        using the tunnel command will throw an error.

        LetsEncrypt servers.


        Changes to the state flow to make access retries infinite as it became apparent

        that in some scenarios the certificate acquisition could fail to occur due to

        containers taking longer to become accessible.
