        Port 3128, which was used for tunneling into devices, was plain TCP and
        has now been closed. Tunnelling is now via `tunnel.mydomain.com:443`
        (see #101). balena-cli versions before v12.38.5 are now incompatible and
        using the tunnel command will throw an error.

        Acquiring a staging certificiate from LetsEncrypt was failing, so

        updated to version 2.8.5, which includes support for using ACMEv2 on the

        LetsEncrypt servers.


        Changes to the state flow to make access retries infinite as it became
        apparent

        that in some scenarios the certificate acquisition could fail to occur
        due to

        containers taking longer to become accessible.

        `docker-compose.yml` after running

        - set the compose file versions to `2.0` to ensure only supported terms
        are used in the `docker-compose.yml` file output

        - quoted empty env values as these need to be passed in as blank, and
        not ommitted

        - include the MDNS publisher service IF the domain being used is a
        .local one

        - corrected spelling of macOS in script messages

        - move sidecar container source into ./src as per convention
