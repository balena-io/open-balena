              body: >
                The migrator previously would only migrate data stored directly
                under PGDATA (as was the case in previous versions of this
                project before switching to versioned directories).


                This adds support for upgrading between versioned data
                directories as well.

                limit

                even though the hard limit is much higher

                This assumes that all clients that can access
                an image, also have access to the application
                it belongs to. The speed gains for device
                authorizations are b/c of how canAccess()
                permissions are applied & how PG is able to
                run the complex application read permission
                on the top level of the query rather than when
                nested 4 into level of `EXISTS (SELECT 1)`.

                I guess we were re-using them in more than
                one places, but that's no longer the case and
                since it's the Nth time I get lost in the file b/c
                of this, I decided to at last make this humble
                PR.

                The getDeviceTypeIdBySlug name was

                It seems that atm it's not needed & on top of
                that, the "edge" has been discontinued for
                some time now. Other than that and
                returning just the slug, the
                `normalizeDeviceType` was literally the
                same as `findBySlug`.

                The cloud API has a rule which enforces this
                restriction, which means that a PATCH of a device's
                supervisor_version could fail if this code returned
                a release of a different public app that has the same
                release_version.

                for the Photon TX2 NX which is a community device type
                that's in progress of being added to the supported

                This reverts commit db990479be2611f24b6262e12e1dfa092473cea0.


                OpenBalena is not the place to do the config vars change for the
                private

                device types such as the UniPi Neuron so we revert this commit
                here.

                This causes problems with the redis level of the cache because
                clearing

                the cache requires clearing the entire redis database which is
                far more

                aggressive than we want to support

                This will reduce the load for the common case where active
                devices are

                not regularly deleted with the potential to briefly respond with
                a 401

                when a device is first deleted. There may also be a slight delay
                for

                restored devices to be able to communicate again however again
                that is

                a very rare case.

                This avoids issues where you pin an application to a release for
                which

                some devices are missing service installs. It also allows
                simplifying

                the "should track latest release" implementation as it no longer
                needs

                to care about creating service installs itself

                This now requires boolean config vars must be `true` or `false`,
                or

                not set if they're optional, previously we compared against just
                `true`

                so any other values would be treated as `false` which could be

                confusing in the case of eg `1`/`on`

                        Instantiating an `OData2AbstractSQL` instance can be

                        reasonable

                        performance improvement

        Port 3128, which was used for tunneling into devices, was plain TCP and
        has now been closed. Tunnelling is now via `tunnel.mydomain.com:443`
        (see #101). balena-cli versions before v12.38.5 are now incompatible and
        using the tunnel command will throw an error.

        Due to a change in the balena-supervisor codebase, only balenaOS
        versions <= 2.49.0 are working with open-balena.

        This documentation change is a band-aid while we resolve the issue.

      hash: d67e29223ff314b40fd745ce78301e550c2c9148
      body: >
        Acquiring a staging certificiate from LetsEncrypt was failing, so
        acme.sh was

        updated to version 2.8.5, which includes support for using ACMEv2 on the

        LetsEncrypt servers.


        Changes to the state flow to make access retries infinite as it became
        apparent

        that in some scenarios the certificate acquisition could fail to occur
        due to

        containers taking longer to become accessible.

      body: |
        Update open-balena-s3 to 2.8.3

        This makes new installations of openBalena use the S3 container as a
        storage backend for the Registry service by default. Existing installs
        should not be affected.

        - remove some `.gitignore` entries as this is also honoured by `balena
        push`

        - added a step to `scripts/quickstart` to produce a single, flat
        `docker-compose.yml` after running

        - set the compose file versions to `2.0` to ensure only supported terms
        are used in the `docker-compose.yml` file output

        - quoted empty env values as these need to be passed in as blank, and
        not ommitted

        - include the MDNS publisher service IF the domain being used is a
        .local one

        - corrected spelling of macOS in script messages

        - move sidecar container source into ./src as per convention
