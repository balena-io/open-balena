# Project-specific config.
#
# All paths must be defined relative to `compose/services.yml` regardless of
# the location of this file, i.e. refer to `my-open-balena-checkout/somedir`
# as `../somedir`. This is because of the way docker-compose handles paths
# when specifying multiple configs and open-balena always specifying
# `compose/services.yml` as the "base" config.
#
# You may view the effective config with `scripts/run-fig-command config`.
